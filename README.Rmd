# Lab report #1

### step 12.2

- Shashank's note: Making the repository was pretty simple since it was already created in GitHub classroom.

### step 12.3

- Shashank's note: Cloning it was fairly new as I've never done this in RStudio but the directions made it pretty self-explanatory.

### step 12.4

- Shashank's note: Honestly I'd rather have used the terminal but the commands were a new change. It was a bit extensive but I got it to work eventually. 

### step 12.5

- Shashank's note: I had a small mishap because it asked me to make a personal access token but once I got that going, it worked. It was only one button so this was a pretty easy step.

### step 12.6

- Shashank's note: It was cool to see my commit on the remote repository and see everyone's activity on the same repo. It was especially important for everyone to operate separately and push each time so we didn't face any merge conflicts.
